- current master value: 4184.0
- nb of cycles added = 0
nb of chains added = 0

Node relaxation is solved to optimality
- node upper bound is 4184.0, tree lower bound is 4183.0

 Search for a feasible solution at node 1
- number of columns in master IP: 17004


New incumbent found with value 4184.0 found by solving the IP with every column of the pool
The node is either infeasible or pruned by bound
LB = 4184.0, UB = 4184.0

----------------------------------------------------------
 The execution of the branch-and-price is complete
- the solution is optimal
- best solution found: value 4184.0 with gap 0.0 %
----------------------------------------------------------

Numbers of cycles per cycle length
- k = 2: 597 cycles
- k = 3: 596 cycles
- k = 4: 187 cycles
In total, 3730 pairs are covered by cycles

Numbers of chains per chain length
- l = 1: 359 chains
- l = 2: 46 chains
- l = 3: 1 chains
In total, 454 pairs are covered by chains

The computed cost of the solution is 4184.0
